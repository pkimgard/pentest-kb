Both Empire and Starkiller(Client GUI) are available in Kali apt repositories. Binairies in path might have slightly different names, I'm using the ones in Kali.

## Server

```
powershell-empire server -h
sudo powershell-empire server
```

## Client

```
powershell-empire -h

# Will connect to localhost
powershell-empire client
```

**General commands**

```
help
back
info
set OPTION VALUE
execute
```

### Listeners

Used to receive shells. Have various options to blend in like different procotols, jitter and delay.

```
# List available
listeners

uselistener LISTENER
```

### Stagers

Generates a first stage file that you trigger on target.

```
usestager
```

### Agents

The result of the second stage stager from the listener. An enrypted channel, with pre-loaded functionality to make things easier - equivalent of a meterpreter.

You give the agents tasks, which will be performed and reported with the set delay. To view status of a task, use `view TASK_ID`

View availble commands with `help`.

## Starkiller

Patience.
