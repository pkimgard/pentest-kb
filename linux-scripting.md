# Linux scripting
Usually this means bash. Differences are stated.

### Comparisons

When used to combine several commands, boolean operators AND and OR executes based on the previous command exit code(0=True, 1=False) and are opposite to one another:

When used in comparisons/statements, they act as expected.

### Double paranthesis construct
- https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/dblparens.html

**Base conversion to decimal:**

```bash
echo $((2#01010101))
echo $((16#5fae))
```

**Arithmetic ops:**

```bash
((counter++))
```

### Functions
- The function must appear above the call to the function itself.
- You don't have to define arguments in the paranthesis in format 2, bash takes all arguments regardless.
- Bash functions dosen't return values, it return exit codes(with 'return').
*Format 1*

```bash
function NaMe {
  # Code here
}
```

*Format 2*

```bash
NaMe () {
  # Code here
}
```

### Variable Scope
- Variable are by default global, if you want to set a local, prepend 'local'.
