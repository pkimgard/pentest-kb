# Webfuzzing and content discovery
Also look at the 'osint.md'.

## Firefox
- CTRL+SHIFT+E/K = Developer tools
- Put 'view-source:' before address to get source.
- Use addon foxyproxy to quickly change between proxies(like burp).
- To tamper with cookie values, check the storage tab.

### Debugger
To view javascripts, go to debugger(or source in chrome).

To make it more easily readable when everything is one line use this button:

To insert a breakpoint in the javascript code, click on the line number so that it turns blue.

### Network
To view all requests sent and recieved, use the network tab. Here you can see and copy all the POST request that you make and also view the responses.

## LFI/RFI/Path traversal
Look for form or URL parameters(like '?file=') that seems to point to a server local file, file extensions are a good indicator.

Getting around filtering:
- ../
- ....//
- Nullbyte, 0x00(hex), %00(URL)
- Current dir trick, ./
- Force dir, forced-dir/../../../

In PHP versions before 5.3.4 you can end a string with a null byte(%00), which may remove file extensions that are added server side (Do it after URL encoding ;). This might also work to get around filtered keywords.

To try a file, these are usually accessible by all users:

- Windows: C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
- Linux: /etc/passwd

## Admin consoles
If left accessible to you, try to get in. Be careful not to lock out any accounts. Try the default creds first.

- Wordpress, site-name/wp-login.php, admin/password.
- Phpmyadmin, phpmyadmin/index.php, root/(blank).

## Automation tools general
## dirsearch.py
`pip install dirsearch`

`dirsearch.py -u [ip] -e toools/webext.txt -o scans/dirs-init --format=md`
## gobuster
`gobuster [dir | dns | vhost]`

## dirbuster
`dirb [url] [wordlist]`

## ffuf
`ffuf -u http://ADDRESS.com/FUZZ -w mywords.txt:FUZZ`

```
-u URL/FUZZ
-w WORDLIST/FUZZ
-H "[HEADER]"
-of md # Output format markdown
-o FILE # Output to file
-t NR # Threads
```

## HTTP automation examples
### Username enumeration
**ffuf**:

`ffuf -u http://10.10.45.53/customers/signup -w SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -mr "An account with this username already exists"`

**hydra**:

`hydra -L SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -p x 10.10.45.53 http-post-form "/customers/signup:username=^USER^&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x:S=An account with this username already exists"`

### Password brute
**ffuf**

`ffuf -u http://10.10.45.53/customers/login -w ab-users.txt:W1,../SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -fc 200`

**hydra**
`hydra -L ab-users.txt -P ../SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt 10.10.45.53 http-post-form "/customers/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Customer Login"`
