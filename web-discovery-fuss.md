# Webfuzzing and content discovery

## Manually scan/enumerate site with browser
View the page source, look for:
- Comments by developers,
- Frameworks and versions used,
- Links to other part of the server,
- Assets used, directories, test for directory listing.

If something is visually blocking text or images, like a div/css blocker. Edit the css style in Inspector to display it differently(like 'display:none;').

Get common files for website:
- robots.txt
- favicon
- sitemap.xml

View standard headers for pages, look for service names and versions. Use firefox devtools, burpsuite or 'curl -v'.

### OSINT

Use **google engine** to search through site.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking

site:tryhackme.com admin(search for admin on this site)

inurl: (search for admin in URLs)

filetype:pdf admin (search for pdfs with admin)

intitle:admin (search fo admin in title)

Use **wayback machine** to see earlier versions:
- https://archive.org/web/

Check the site with **Wappalyzer** to identify technologies used(online or firefox extension).

Search the company name on **github** to see if any public repisotories exist.

Check for **Amazon S3 buckets** in source and elsewhere too see if there's more information.
