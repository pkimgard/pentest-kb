# Password generation
## Sed magic on lists
Use to reduce list size due to password policies. Mainly stolen from the htb academy login brute force module.

Remove every word smaller than x characters(in this case 8).

`sed -ri '/^.{,7}$/d' [filename].txt`

Remove every word that doesn't contain special characters.

```sed -ri '/[!-/:-@\[-`\{-~]+/!d' [filename].txt```

Remove every word not containing numbers.

`sed -ri '/[0-9]+/!d' [filename].txt`
